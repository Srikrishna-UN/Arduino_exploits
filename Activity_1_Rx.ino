  Make sure that  Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 package is chosen and not the Mbed OS package

  HW connections: Connect this Rx board's pin 2 (GPIO 1, RX0) to 
  the Tx board's Pin no. 1 (GPIO 0, TX0), note that UART0 of both the boards
  are used to communicate the commands from Tx board to Rx board.
  Tx board receives the command from the user on Serial (USB) port and 
  passes to the Rx board through UART0. The Rx board uses uart_getc() SDK function
  to recieve the commands from the UART0 device.
  Caution: Though only Tx board is sending data to Rx board, make sure
  that both Tx and Rx pins are cross connected between Tx and Rx boards.
  Connect the GND (pin no. 3) of both the boards connected too.
  
 It blinks the built-in LED of the RX board connected through UART0
 The program runs on Rx board. It receives commands from tx board (USB Serial interface)
 It receives the following commands (single letter) on UART0 from the TX board
 The command controls the blinking rate of its built-in LED.
 Commands: 'o' or 'O': ON, 'f' or 'F': OFF, 
 from 1 to 9 -> blink at 100 to 900 msecs
